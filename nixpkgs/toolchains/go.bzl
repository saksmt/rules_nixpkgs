    Use go toolchain from Nixpkgs. Will fail if not a nix-based platform.

    By default rules_go configures go toolchain to be downloaded as binaries (which doesn't work on NixOS),
    there is a way to tell rules_go to look into environment and find local go binary which is not hermetic.
    This command allows to setup hermetic go sdk from Nixpkgs, which should be considerate as best practice.
